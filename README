The colorschemes I've seen on vim.sf.net seem to all have dark
backgrounds, but the dark backgrounds really bother my eyes.
Also, the default white background of gvim is too bright for me.
Perhaps I'm alone, but a nice off-white background allows me to
merrily spend all day long staring at screen after screen after
screen of code, day after day, week after week, year after
year...  Editing code, reviewing code, documenting code,
debugging code, dreaming code in the nightmare that has become my
life... Oh, well -- at least this pleasant little colorscheme helps me
get through the day.
The screen capture at http://vim.eralston.net/?id=navajo should help you
decide whether this colorscheme is right for you.

Your first impression may be that the background is kinda ugly,
and I guess that's probably true.  But hey, I find it much more
readable, and it sure beats a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.
It works well in the gui, and to get a similar background
in a color xterm, start your xterm with
"xterm -bg NavajoWhite3 -fg black"

If you have any questions, feel free to ask; but to save you the
time and effort, the answer will invariably be 42.
